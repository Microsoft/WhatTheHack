# What, Why and How

- "What the Hack" is a challenge based hackathon format
- Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished
- Challenges are not step-by-step labs
- Attendees work in teams of 3 to 5 people to solve the challenges
- Attendees "learn from" and "share with" each other
- By having to "figure it out", attendee knowledge retention is greater
- Proctors provide guidance, but not answers to the teams
- Emcees provide lectures & demos to setup challenges & review solutions
- What the Hack can be hosted in-person or virtually via MS Teams

# How to Add Your Hack

We welcome all new hacks! The process for doing this is:
- Fork this repo into your own github account
- Create a new branch for your work
- Add a new top level folder using the next number in sequence, eg:
	- 011-BigNewHack
- Within this folder, create two folders, each with two folders with in that looks like this:
	- Host
		- Guides
		- Solutions
	- Student
		- Guides
		- Resources
- The content of each folder should be:
	- **Student/Guides**: The Student's Guide
	- **Student/Resources**: Any template or "starter" files that students may need in challenges
	- **Host/Guides**: The Proctor's Guide lives here as well as any Lecture slide decks
	- **Host/Solutions**: Specific files that the proctors might need that have solutions in them.
- Once your branch and repo have all your content and it formatted correctly, follow the instructions on this page to submit a pull request back to the main repository:
