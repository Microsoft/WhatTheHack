# Identity for Developers

## Introduction

The Identity for Developers Hack will provide you a deep dive experience into enabling internal and external identity solutions for your applications. Identity is a booming area of the Microsoft Cloud platform and enabling identity solutions in your engagements allows for faster production deployments.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack, we'll enable identity solutions for several applications, demonstrating how to

1. Provision several types of Managed Identities
2. Set up an Azure Active Directory and enable External Identities
3. Set up an Azure Active Directory B2C directory for customer-facing applications, utilizing:
   a. Out of the box user flows
   b. Customized policies
   c. REST APIs for token enrichment and custom approval workflows
